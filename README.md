#### How it Works
- BookBuy offers a unique buying and selling service for students to utilize at absolutely no charge. We operate by hosting a single central medium for students to not only find cheaper used textbooks, but to also market and sell their own textbooks.
- Students come to one single location to search for textbooks, and also sell them. BookBuy is the one stop spot for every student's textbook troubles.
- Students only need to disclose a name and email on sign up, and when a book is posted the only thing publicly available is the given name, and the book information. All communication is done through BookBuy eliminating the need to give out personal info like a phone number or email.

#### Technology
- BookBuy is built on top of Firebase and React/Redux. Utilizing the serverless architecture not only allowed for rapid development, but also allows for a scaleable and maintainable codebase. I really liked working with Firebase.
- Authentication, Postings, Chats and Notifications are all done through Firebase and Cloud Functions. Email services are done through Mailgun. Post image recognition utilizes GCP AI platform. The frontend is created using React and Redux for state management.
